It starts with linear algebra fundamentals and their geometric interpretation, including matrices, linear operators, and matrix decompositions like eigen-, spectral-, and singular vector decompositions. The course then moves to optimization, encompassing unconstrained and constrained, linear and non-linear, as well as convex and non-convex optimization; local and global optimality conditions; and basic optimization problem classes. Applications in machine learning, signal processing, and engineering illustrate the techniques developed.",

Also, it examines skeletal injury treatment design considerations, alongside computational (finite element and statistical analysis) and experimental (mechanical testing of crash test dummies, artificial bones, PMHS, and ex-vivo specimens) research methods in injury and orthopedic biomechanics. Forensic biomechanics case studies and protective equipment design and analysis provide practical application opportunities.",
